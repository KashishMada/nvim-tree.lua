INTRODUCTION                                       *nvim-tree-introduction*

==============================================================================
QUICK START                                        *nvim-tree-quickstart*

open the tree with :LuaTreeToggle
>
  nnoremap <C-n> :LuaTreeToggle<CR>
  lua require 'tree'.toggle()
<

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                           *nvim-tree-commands*

|:LuaTreeToggle| 	                          *:LuaTreeToggle*

open or close the tree

|:LuaTreeRefresh|			          *:LuaTreeRefresh*

refresh the tree

|:LuaTreeFindFile|				  *:LuaTreeFindFile*

The command will change the cursor in the tree for the current bufname.

It will also open the leafs of the tree leading to the file in the buffer 
(if you opened a file with something else than the LuaTree, like `fzf`)

==============================================================================
OPTIONS				                  *nvim-tree-options*

|g:lua_tree_size|				*g:lua_tree_size*

width of the window (default to 30)

|g:lua_tree_side|				*g:lua_tree_side*

where the window will open (default to 'left')
- 'left' or 'right'

|g:lua_tree_ignore|				*g:lua_tree_ignore*

An array of strings that the tree won't display.
Each pattern is passed into the 'ls' function as `--ignore=PATTERN`
>
    example: let g:lua_tree_ignore = [ '.git', 'node_modules' ]

|g:lua_tree_show_icons|			        *g:lua_tree_show_icons*

Dictionnary, if your terminal or font doesn't support certain unicode
character, the tree UI might be messed up. The following configuration
can disable icons per type:
>
    let g:lua_tree_show_icons = {
	\ 'git': 1,
	\ 'folders': 1,
	\ 'icons': 1
	\}

Can be one of `1` and `0` for each key. By default the tree will try
to render the icons. The `icons` key can only work if `vim-devicons`
is installed and in your |runtimepath|

|g:lua_tree_follow|				*g:lua_tree_follow*

Can be `0` or `1`. When `1`, will bind |:LuaTreeFindFile| to |BufEnter|
Default is 0

|g:lua_tree_auto_open|				*g:lua_tree_auto_open*

Can be `0` or `1`. When `1`, will bind |VimEnter| to automatically
open tree on startup if no files are specified.
Default is 0

|g:lua_tree_auto_close|				*g:lua_tree_auto_close*

Can be `0` or `1`. When `1`, will bind |BufEnter| to automatically
close the tree if it's the last window.
Default is 0

INFORMATIONS				        *nvim-tree-info*

|KeyBindings|				        *nvim-tree-keybindings*

- move around like in any vim buffer
- '<CR>' on '..' will cd in the above directory
- typing '.' will cd in the directory under the cursor

- type 'a' to add a file
- type 'r' to rename a file
- type 'd' to delete a file (will prompt for confirmation)

- if the file is a directory, '<CR>' will open the directory
- otherwise it will open the file in the buffer near the tree
- if the file is a symlink, '<CR>' will follow the symlink
- type '<C-v>' will open the file in a vertical split
- type '<C-x>' will open the file in a horizontal split
- type '<C-t>' will open the file in a new tab

- Double left click acts like '<CR>'
- Double right click acts like '.'

|Features|					*nvim-tree-features*

File icons with vim-devicons.

Uses other type of icons so a good font support is recommended.
If the tree renders weird glyphs, install correct fonts or try to change
your terminal.

Syntax highlighting uses g:terminal_color_ from colorschemes, fallbacks to
ugly colors otherwise.

Git integration tells when a file is:
- ✗  unstaged or folder is dirty
- ✓  staged
- ★  new file
- ✓✗ partially staged
- ✓★ new file staged
- ═  merging
- ➜  renamed

Mouse support defined in |KeyBindings|
